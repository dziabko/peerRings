# PeerRings
Using Looprings protocol for interacting with their smart contracts, we allow users using ERC20 tokens to interact with each other and send transfer ERC 20 tokens with each other.

This is the front end Android application which communicated with our backend talking with the Ethereum networks. Here we provide a useful tool to help facilitate peer to peer transactions using QR codes to send money to each other. This uses decentralized wallets, and helps users set up transactions.
